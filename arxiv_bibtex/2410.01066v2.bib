  abstract={ LLMs when used with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), are greatly improving the SOTA of translating natural language queries to structured and correct SQL. Unlike previous reviews, this survey provides a comprehensive study of the evolution of LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, from early rule-based models to advanced LLM approaches that use (RAG) systems. We discuss benchmarks, evaluation methods, and evaluation metrics. Also, we uniquely study the use of Graph RAGs for better contextual accuracy and schema linking in these systems. Finally, we highlight key challenges such as computational efficiency, model robustness, and data privacy toward improvements of LLM-based text-to-SQL systems. }
