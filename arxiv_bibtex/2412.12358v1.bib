  abstract={ We present BioRAGent, an interactive web-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for biomedical question answering. The system uses large language models (LLMs) for query expansion, snippet extraction, and answer generation while maintaining transparency through citation links to the source documents and displaying generated queries for further editing. Building on our successful participation in the BioASQ 2024 challenge, we demonstrate how few-shot learning with LLMs can be effectively applied for a professional search setting. The system supports both direct short paragraph style responses and responses with inline citations. Our demo is available online, and the source code is publicly accessible through GitHub. }
